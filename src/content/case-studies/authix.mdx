> **Summary**: Practical case study showing how I found, exploited, and fixed a vuln in my Authix app, then prevented regressions with CI.

## Context & Threat Model

- Stack: Next.js, TypeScript, Prisma, Supabase
- Risk focus: session handling, CORS/CSRF, content injection

## Exploit (PoC)

Describe the minimal steps to reproduce. Include a short GIF or screenshots in `/public/case-studies/authix/`.

## Fix (Diff)

Explain the patch (why it works, tests added). Link to `vuln` vs `secure` branches.

## Prevention

- **CSP** hardened
- **Semgrep** rules enabled in CI
- **ZAP Baseline** on PRs

## Evidence

- CI badge (failing → passing)
- ZAP report excerpt

## Takeaways

- Root cause, defense-in-depth, and dev education notes.
